-What _printf does. (mention that it's built to be able to add more functions simply by using a struct. Simply add more elements ot the struct, pointing to functions you create. Mention that one would also have to change a hardcoded value for iterating through the struct, which could probably be changed so that it isnt necessary to do.
-What conversions it currently allows (%c, %s, %%, %d, %i)
    +include extra hyperlinks to each individual section for conversions. If possible make the list only visible fi you click it? Idk how complicated that is.
